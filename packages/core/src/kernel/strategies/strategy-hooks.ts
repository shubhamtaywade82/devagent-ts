/**
 * StrategyHooks — the product-side port of the execution loop.
 *
 * Roadmap step 1 (docs/guide/kernel.md §Migration status): the ReAct loop
 * lived hard-coded inside `Agent.runUserMessage`, entangled with CLI-only
 * concerns — escalation (quick→cloud), streamed-output buffering, dynamic
 * tool selection, human approvals, learning telemetry. Those concerns are
 * *product policies*, not loop mechanics, but the loop cannot ignore them
 * either. The seam this module defines: the kernel strategy owns the loop
 * (turns, tool dispatch, observations, budgets, cancellation, nudges) and
 * delegates every product policy to an optional hook.
 *
 * A strategy MUST run correctly with zero hooks (headless default path:
 * model calls via ModelGateway, tools advertised via ToolGateway schemas).
 * Every hook is optional and individually skippable.
 *
 * Ownership contract for tool observations:
 *   - without `onToolObserved`, the strategy pushes the tool result into
 *     the context and runs its own loop detector;
 *   - with `onToolObserved`, the hook OWNS the observation — it decides
 *     how/whether the result is pushed (e.g. the CLI's compact
 *     PathEscapeError form) and returns { abortRun } when its loop policy
 *     fires. The strategy then never double-pushes.
