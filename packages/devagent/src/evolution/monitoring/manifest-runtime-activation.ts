/**
 * ManifestRuntimeActivationController — the PRODUCTION
 * RuntimeActivationController (v2.3.3).
 *
 * The seam in runtime-activation.ts describes the runtime half of activation
 * and rollback ("the process that actually executes the harness"). For Nexum
 * that process is the harness manifest consumer: the running system loads
 * `nexum.harness.json` to know which harness policy/version it executes —
 * the same manifest the mutation strategies legitimately write into. This
 * controller makes that file the ACTIVATION CONTRACT:
 *
 *   switchTo(H(n))  →  resolve H(n) to a commit (registry first, then any
 *                      git-resolvable ref) → verify the commit exists in the
 *                      repository → atomically write the `activeHarness`
 *                      pointer into the manifest → re-read and verify the
 *                      pointer actually landed.
 *
 * Design constraints honored:
 *   - FAIL-CLOSED: switching to an unknown harness (no registry row and no
 *     resolvable git ref) throws; nothing is written.
 *   - ATOMIC: the pointer update is tmp-file + rename in the manifest's
 *     directory; a crashed write can never leave a half-file manifest.
 *   - SELF-VERIFYING: after the write the manifest is re-read and the
 *     pointer checked; a mismatch restores the previous content and throws.
 *   - PRESERVING: strategy-written manifest fields (target, scope, policy)
 *     survive activation writes untouched.
 *   - HEALTH IS REAL: harnessHealth() verifies the harness's commit exists
 *     in the repository (git cat-file), so the rollback orchestrator's
 *     post-switch verification is external reality, not self-report.
 *
 * Default OFF: the CLI only wires this controller under the explicit
 * `--activate-runtime` flag, and the engine only calls switchTo() for an
 * experiment that reached ACTIVE (CI passed + review approved).
