/**
 * Runtime activation rollback — the RUNTIME half of the rollback path.
 *
 * Registry rollback (HarnessRegistry.rollbackTo) only moves the version
 * lineage pointer; whether the LIVE process actually stops executing the
 * regressed harness depends on how the runtime loads the harness. This
 * module makes runtime rollback explicit and verifiable:
 *
 *   ACTIVE H(n) ──monitor regression──→ freeze H(n)
 *     → switch runtime → H(n-1)
 *     → verify H(n-1) healthy in the runtime
 *     → persist: REGRESSED → ROLLBACK → ACTIVE + registry.rollbackTo
 *
 * If the switch or the post-switch health verification fails, the runtime
 * is switched back to the (regressed) original and the experiment stays at
 * REGRESSED — an honest, non-silent state that pageable operations can act
 * on. A rollback is never reported as complete unless the prior harness is
 * actually running again.
