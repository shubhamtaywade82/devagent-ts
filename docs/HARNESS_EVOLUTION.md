# Nexum Harness Evolution: Self-Developing Agent Runtime

Nexum implements a meta-evolutionary control loop inspired by the **HarnessDev** paradigm ($H = \langle E, T, C, S, L, V \rangle$).

While traditional coding agents learn only _task-level_ lessons, Nexum can diagnose its own runtime execution failures, identify architectural weaknesses in its execution harness, formulate targeted mutation hypotheses, benchmark candidate changes against multi-objective Pareto dimensions, and autonomously prepare scientific GitHub Pull Requests with empirical evidence matrices.

---

## 1. The Harness Model: $H = \langle E, T, C, S, L, V \rangle$

Nexum treats the agent harness as a formal six-tuple:

```text
H = ⟨ E, T, C, S, L, V ⟩

    │  │  │  │  └───── Lifecycle, Recovery & Error Escalation

## 2. The Evolutionary Control Loop

The meta-harness control loop operates as a closed feedback cycle:

```text
Telemetry (Episodes)
       ↓
Failure Diagnoser (Root Cause & Taxonomy)
       ↓
Evolution Planner (Single-Component Scoped Hypothesis)
       ↓
Candidate Mutation & Benchmark Runner
       ↓
Multi-Objective Comparator (Pareto Frontiers & Hard Regression Gates)
       ↓
       ├─ [PROMOTE] → Register in SQLite & Open GitHub Draft PR
       └─ [REJECT]  → Demote candidate & Record rationale
```

### The Single-Component Scoping Principle

To prevent regression cascades, every evolution candidate mutation is strictly confined to **one subsystem** at a time ($E$, $T$, $C$, $S$, $L$, or $V$). Multi-component mutations are blocked by the `EvolutionPlanner`.

### Multi-Objective Pareto Dimensions & Regression Gates

Candidate versions are evaluated across four objective dimensions:

1. **Capability**: Task success rate and verification pass rate.
2. **Reliability**: Tool error reduction, elimination of false successes, loop abort rate.
3. **Efficiency**: Token overhead and execution latency (capped at $\le 25\%$ token overhead).
4. **Generalization**: Performance on held-out tasks and cross-model transferability.

**Hard Regression Gates**: Any candidate that degrades reliability by $> 5\%$, generalization by $> 5\%$, or capability by $> 2\%$ is immediately **rejected**.

## 3. CLI Reference (`nexum evolve`)

```bash
# View all evolution options
nexum evolve --help

# Show evolutionary lineage (H0 -> Hn) and currently active baseline
nexum evolve --history

# Inspect recent episode failures in .nexum/lessons.db and recommend mutations
nexum evolve --diagnose

# Run benchmark suites matching current weaknesses
nexum evolve --benchmark

# Evaluate and benchmark a candidate harness mutation live

## 4. Interactive TUI Commands (`/evolve`)

Inside the interactive terminal workspace (`nexum`), developers can control evolution without leaving the TUI:

- `/evolve` or `/evolve history`: Displays the registered version tree and active baseline.
- `/evolve diagnose`: Analyzes recent session episodes and prints detected weaknesses with expected impact deltas.
- `/evolve benchmark`: Displays recommended benchmark categories for active weaknesses.
- `/evolve rollback <id>`: Instantly demotes newer versions and restores version `<id>` as active.

---

## 5. Provenance & Delivery Engine

When a candidate harness mutation is validated and promoted, the `GitDeliveryEngine`:

1. Creates an isolated git branch: `evolution/<version-id>-<component>`
2. Formats a structured, research-grade commit message with hypothesis and score deltas.
3. Prepares a GitHub Draft PR body with a complete empirical evidence table:

```markdown
## Nexum Harness Evolution — Promoted Mutation `H1`

### 1. Hypothesis & Root Cause

- **Target Component:** `execution`
- **Parent Version:** `H0`
- **Hypothesis:** IF loop detection thresholds are tightened THEN loop aborts will decrease.

### 2. Empirical Evaluation

| Dimension          |  Delta   | Interpretation                                |

## 6. Closed-Loop v2: Target Formation, Experience Learning & the Experiment State Machine

The v1 loop answers _"did this candidate score higher?"_. The v2 closed-loop engine (`src/evolution/engine-v2.ts`, `ClosedLoopEngine`) implements the deeper question from the Self-Developing Agents research: _"which changes reliably improve the engineering system?"_. It adds three layers on top of the v1 foundation.

### 6.1 Three Separated Kinds of Learning

```text
                      NEXUM
                        │
          ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
          │             │             │
       TASK         EXPERIENCE      HARNESS
       LEARNING     LEARNING        EVOLUTION
          │             │             │
       skills        evidence       experiments
       lessons       digests        state machine
          │             │             │
          └─────────────┼─────────────┘
                        │
                 VALIDATED CAPABILITY
```

- **Task learning** (existing, `src/learning/`): `EpisodeRecorder → Grader → Reflector → LessonStore → SkillSynthesizer`.
- **Experience learning** (new, `src/evolution/experience/`): `TrajectoryAnalyzer → ExperienceStore → EvidenceAggregator → TransferAnalyzer`. Encodes the S³Gym findings: no single memory representation wins (raw trajectory / summary / aggregated statistics trade places per task class), self-judgment is a poor predictor (evidence confidence is down-weighted when no verifier ran), and every record binds the executor model + harness version that produced it.
- **Harness evolution** (new, `src/evolution/experiments/`, `src/evolution/acceptance/`): `ExperimentController`, the lifecycle state machine, and the `AcceptanceController`.

### 6.2 Target Formation (the Aspire layer)

`src/evolution/targets/target-engine.ts` sits between diagnosis and planning. It refuses to answer _"which file should I change?"_ until it has answered _"what capability is actually failing?"_ — producing an `ImprovementTarget` with a capability, an operationalized desired outcome, observable symptoms, must-move metrics, affected components (including plausible cross-component causes), a confidence score, and a split-aware evaluation plan. Weak evidence yields no target: the loop gathers more telemetry instead of mutating on a vague goal.

### 6.3 The Evolution State Machine

Promotion is no longer a single function call. A candidate must traverse:

```text
OBSERVED → DIAGNOSED → TARGETED → HYPOTHESIS → CANDIDATE → EVALUATING →
VALIDATED → GENERALIZED → ELIGIBLE → DELIVERED → CI_PENDING → CI_PASSED →
REVIEW_PENDING → APPROVED → ACCEPTED → ACTIVE

Failure paths:
  EVALUATING     ──→ REJECTED            (Stage A / Stage B gate failed)
  GENERALIZED    ──→ REJECTED            (held-out / transfer regression,
                                          or generalization policy unmet)
  CI_PENDING     ──→ CI_FAILED           (GitHub CI red)   ──→ CANDIDATE (rework)
  REVIEW_PENDING ──→ CHANGES_REQUESTED   (human review)    ──→ CANDIDATE (rework)
  ACTIVE         ──→ REGRESSED           (post-deploy monitoring) → ROLLBACK → ACTIVE (prior)
```

"Declared promotions" are structurally impossible: `EvolutionStateMachine` rejects skipped stages.

CI and review are FIRST-CLASS lifecycle states (v2.1): a passing CI run has its own explicit transition (`CI_PENDING → CI_PASSED → REVIEW_PENDING`), and so does an approval (`REVIEW_PENDING → APPROVED`). External feedback can no longer be silently dropped by the lifecycle — a CI verdict ALWAYS advances the experiment, in both directions. Legacy persisted records using the old `REVIEWED` state name are normalized onto `REVIEW_PENDING` via `normalizeLegacyState()`.

### 6.4 Two-Stage Candidate Selection

`src/evolution/comparison/two-stage-selector.ts` separates experiment validity from improvement:

- **Stage A — statistical / execution validity**: runs completed, verifier coverage, verifier evidence validity, no catastrophic regressions, sufficient sample size.
- **Stage B — improvement validity**: capability or reliability gain, no held-out regression, transfer evidence, acceptable token cost.

### 6.5 Fixed-Executor Evaluation & the Generalization Gate

`src/evolution/evaluation/fixed-executor.ts` treats evaluator model, harness candidate, and task suite as independent variables and builds the H0..Hn × executor matrix. `src/evolution/generalization/generalization-gate.ts` grants `GENERALIZED` only when the candidate holds or improves held-out success under the primary executor and does not collapse under any transfer executor, and reports **executor sensitivity** (spread of held-out deltas across executors) plus **direction agreement** — the research metrics for separating "the harness improved" from "this model + harness combination got lucky".

#### Generalization policy

The gate's enforcement level is configurable (`ClosedLoopEngineOptions.generalizationPolicy`):

| Policy                    | Behavior                                                                                                                                         |
| :------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `optional` (default)      | Held-out/transfer evidence is recorded when supplied; its absence never blocks eligibility. Development mode.                                    |
| `required`                | A fixed-executor matrix MUST be supplied and the gate MUST pass, otherwise the candidate is rejected at `GENERALIZED → REJECTED`. Research mode. |
| `required-for-production` | `required` plus transfer-executor evidence MUST be present. Production evolution.                                                                |

This closes the "permissive held-out gate" loophole: a candidate can no longer become eligible without the fixed-executor evidence the methodology demands.

### 6.6 Mutation Scope Escalation

The single-component scoping principle remains the default, but `src/evolution/mutation/mutation-scope.ts` allows explicit escalation to a compound hypothesis after repeated single-component experiments fail to move the same capability target (bounded component span, full audit rationale).

### 6.7 Persistent Experiment Provenance in PRs

Every experiment is a persistent record (`ExperimentRecord`) with parent/candidate harness + commit, the formed target, the hypothesis, the executor matrix, visible/held-out/transfer evaluation, the two-stage decision, CI status, and review state. Eligible candidates get an evolution branch + draft PR whose body embeds the machine-readable provenance:

```yaml
experiment:
  id: exp-00142
parent:
  harness: H17
  commit: abc123
candidate:
  harness: H18
  commit: def456
target:
  capability: tool_utilization
executor:
  primary: qwen3-coder
  transfer:
    - gemini-2.5
evaluation:
  visible: {}
  held_out: {}
  transfer: {}
decision:
  result: eligible
ci:
  status: pending
review:
  state: pending
```

### 6.8 First-Class Loop Health Metrics

`src/evolution/metrics.ts` tracks: visible/held-out/transfer gains, retention rate, regression rate, rollback rate, false promotion rate, experience→improvement correlation, executor sensitivity, and — most importantly — **promotion precision**:

```text
promotion precision = # candidates actually better on held-out evaluation
                      ------------------------------------------------
                      # candidates promoted
```

### 6.9 v2 CLI Reference

```bash
# Form the capability-level improvement target from recent episodes (Aspire layer)
nexum evolve --target

# Show the evidence-grounded experience digest per task class (S³Gym layer)
nexum evolve --experience

# List experiment records with lifecycle states, CI and review status
nexum evolve --experiments

# Loop health report: promotion precision, retention, rollback, sensitivity
nexum evolve --report

# Self-development actuator: target → isolated worktree → planned edits →
# verification → candidate commit (needs --repo; benchmarks plug in separately)
nexum evolve --mutate --repo /path/to/harness --parent HEAD

# Post-activation health verdict from operational telemetry (JSONL)
nexum evolve --monitor --harness H5 --telemetry telemetry.jsonl
```

### 6.10 The Self-Development Actuator (HarnessMutationExecutor)

Everything upstream decides WHAT should change; `src/evolution/mutation/mutation-executor.ts` performs the actual self-modification and turns it into a verifiable candidate artifact. This is the component that turns Nexum from self-evaluating into self-developing:

```text
prepareWorkspace  → isolated git worktree branched at the parent commit
inspectTarget     → CodeChangePlan (pluggable MutationStrategy)
implement         → writes the planned edits (scope-guarded)
verify            → scope guard + verification commands
finalize          → candidate commit + diff artifact for the experiment
dispose           → worktree cleanup
```

Key properties:

- **Strategy-pluggable**: the default `HeuristicMutationStrategy` produces a deterministic self-describing harness policy edit; real self-modification plugs in a strategy backed by the agent runtime or an LLM. The executor only demands that every produced edit stays inside the mutation scope's component paths and survives verification.
- **Scope-guarded**: edits outside the allowed paths for the target component (or path-escaping edits) are rejected before they touch the worktree — the mutation scope policy is enforced at the filesystem boundary, not just on paper.
- **Isolated**: each candidate is a git worktree, so parallel experiments never interfere and the resulting diff is exactly the mutation.

`ClosedLoopEngine.runEvolutionCycle()` chains the actuator with the full experiment pipeline: mutation → candidate commit → benchmark callback → two-stage + generalization gates → delivery preparation. Failures are reported per stage (`prepare` / `implement` / `verify` / `finalize` / `evaluate`) with all artifacts preserved for rework.

### 6.11 GitHubDeliveryAdapter — the autonomous delivery loop

`src/evolution/delivery/github-adapter.ts` performs the REAL Git/GitHub operations and feeds external results back into the `ExperimentController`, completing the end-to-end pipeline:

```text
mutation → git commit → push branch → create PR → CI → review → feedback
        → rework (CI_FAILED / CHANGES_REQUESTED → CANDIDATE) → accept → merge
```

- `deliverExperiment()` commits, pushes the evolution branch, and opens the PR carrying the provenance body.
- `syncCiFeedback()` polls check-runs and reports the verdict through `reportCiResult()` — including the honest case: a polling timeout reports `pending` and leaves the lifecycle at `CI_PENDING` rather than fabricating a verdict.
- `syncReviewFeedback()` reads the LATEST human review and reports it through `reportReviewOutcome()` (`APPROVED` / `CHANGES_REQUESTED`).
- Git and HTTP are injectable, so the adapter is fully unit-testable without network access.

### 6.12 ActivationMonitor — post-activation telemetry

The `ACTIVE → REGRESSED` path is driven by live operational telemetry, not benchmark reruns. `src/evolution/monitoring/activation-monitor.ts` holds a per-harness performance **envelope** (derived from the parent harness's acceptance evaluation at activation time) and classifies ingested telemetry:

- Channels: task success rate, false success rate, tool error rate, loop abort rate, verification failure rate, token consumption, latency, and task-class distribution drift.
- Verdicts: `healthy` → `degrading` (warn band) → `regressed` (hard band; triggers rollback automatically via `ClosedLoopEngine.evaluateActivation()`).
- Samples are episode-weighted, and a task-class distribution drift beyond tolerance flags that envelope comparisons are no longer like-for-like.

This closes the loop: run → observe → learn → improve → validate → deploy → **monitor** → learn again.

### 6.14 AgentMutationStrategy — real autonomous code mutation (v2.2)

The default `HeuristicMutationStrategy` modifies the repository but not the harness runtime's behavior: it writes a self-describing `nexum.harness.json` policy file. `src/evolution/mutation/agent-mutation.ts` closes that gap with the first-class agent boundary:

```text
target → EngineeringAgentRuntime.proposeMutation()
           ├─ inspects the worktree  (AgentWorkspaceView: readFile / listFiles)
           ├─ consults evidence      (experienceDigest / telemetryDigest)
           └─ proposes concrete file edits
       → AgentMutationStrategy maps proposals → scope-attributed CodeChangePlan
       → executor implement / verify / finalize (unchanged safety pipeline)
       → actual runtime behavior changes → benchmarks → matrix → PR
```

- `EngineeringAgentRuntime` is the pluggable seam for Nexum's own engineering runtime, an LLM API, or a sandboxed coding agent. Implementations only PROPOSE — the executor applies, verifies, and commits.
- The agent receives the allowed-path list (`allowedPathsFor(scope)`) and is asked to respect it, but nothing is trusted: enforcement stays with the executor (defense in depth).
- Safety envelope: a declined agent aborts the cycle without a candidate (`AgentDeclinedError`); a runaway response exceeding `maxEdits` aborts with `AgentMutationError`.
- `ScriptedAgentRuntime` wraps a plain handler for deterministic tests and dry runs.

This is the transition from "self-modifying repository" to **self-developing harness**: the mutation touches the implementation the benchmark suite actually exercises.

### 6.15 Scope guard v2 — actual-diff verification

The v2.1 guard checked only the PLANNED edits (`planned ⊆ allowed`). A strategy with disk access could smuggle undeclared files into the worktree and pass. The v2.2 `verify()` adds a second, independent guard:

```text
1. PLANNED ⊆ ALLOWED            (unchanged: per-edit component-path check)
2. ACTUAL ⊆ DECLARED ∪ EXTRAS   (new: git diff vs parent commit + untracked files)
```

Every path that actually changed on disk — snapshotted BEFORE verification commands run so tool artifacts cannot pollute the audit — must have been declared in the plan (or be covered by the configured `extraAllowedPaths` carve-out). Undeclared changes fail verification with `actualDiffViolations`, whatever component directory they landed in. The invariant the executor enforces is exactly:

> actual changed files ⊆ allowed mutation paths

### 6.16 The canonical production cycle (engine-integrated delivery)

As of v2.2 the canonical production path is engine-internal: when a `GitHubDeliveryAdapter` is wired and the cycle input supplies `github`, `runEvolutionCycle()` continues past eligibility through real delivery, with every external verdict fed back into the lifecycle inside the workspace lifetime:

```text
target → mutation → evaluation → eligibility
       → push mutation branch → open PR (branch overridden to the REAL mutation branch)
       → poll CI  (CI_PENDING → CI_PASSED | CI_FAILED, timeout stays honest pending)
       → poll review (REVIEW_PENDING → APPROVED | CHANGES_REQUESTED)
       → accept on approval (APPROVED → ACCEPTED → ACTIVE) → merge
       → CI_FAILED / CHANGES_REQUESTED → beginRework() re-enters the loop at CANDIDATE
```

The workspace lifecycle is owned by the cycle itself: the worktree is disposed via `try/finally` on every exit path — success, stage failure, benchmark failure — while the candidate branch and commit survive in the repository for review, rework, and provenance. `retainWorkspace: true` plus `disposeWorkspace()` supports manual delivery flows.

### 6.17 Runtime activation rollback

`HarnessRegistry.rollbackTo()` moves the version-lineage pointer; whether the LIVE process stops executing the regressed harness is a different question. `src/evolution/monitoring/runtime-activation.ts` makes runtime rollback explicit and verifiable:

```text
ACTIVE H(n) → monitor regression → freeze H(n)
  → switch runtime → H(n-1)
  → verify H(n-1) healthy in the runtime
  → persist: REGRESSED → ROLLBACK → ACTIVE + registry.rollbackTo
```

- `RuntimeActivationController` (injectable): `activeHarness()` / `switchTo()` / optional `freeze()` and `harnessHealth()`.
- `RuntimeRollbackOrchestrator.rollback()` drives the full sequence and returns a step-by-step audit report. If the switch fails or the post-switch health verification fails, the runtime is restored to the original harness and the experiment stays honestly at REGRESSED — a rollback is never reported as complete unless the prior harness is actually running again.
- Engine wiring: `rollbackActive()` / `evaluateActivationLive()` (awaited runtime rollback for production monitor ticks) and `activateOnRuntime()` (switches the live runtime onto an accepted candidate — the runtime half of activation). Without a runtime controller the loop keeps the v2.1 logical rollback (`handleRegression`), parking at ROLLBACK.

### 6.18 NexumEngineeringAgentRuntime — the production agent wiring (v2.3)

v2.2's `EngineeringAgentRuntime` seam shipped with only the deterministic `ScriptedAgentRuntime`, leaving "what actually proposes edits in production" as the open question. `src/evolution/mutation/nexum-agent-runtime.ts` closes it: **Nexum's own engineering loop**, as a bounded tool-calling chat cycle over the same `Provider` surface the interactive agent uses, pointed at the confined candidate worktree.

```text
ClosedLoopEngine (agentRuntime)
  ↓  auto-builds GitWorktreeMutationExecutor + AgentMutationStrategy
NexumEngineeringAgentRuntime
  ↓  bounded tool loop over EngineeringChatClient (Nexum Provider)
list_files / read_file / propose_edit / finish / decline
  ↓  proposals only — executor applies, verifies (actual-diff audit),
     commits, benchmarks, delivers
```

- **Tool protocol** (all confined to the `AgentWorkspaceView`): `list_files`, `read_file` (read-only inspection), `propose_edit` (queues FULL file content + rationale), `finish` (ends with queued edits), `decline` (no safe mutation — cycle aborts without a candidate). Tool arguments are accepted as objects (Ollama shape) or JSON strings (other providers).
- **Safety layers, in order**: (1) the system prompt carries the propose-only contract and the allowed-path list; (2) `propose_edit` rejects out-of-scope paths at queue time with a tool error the agent can read and self-correct; (3) the final response is re-audited fail-closed — any queued violation, budget overrun (`maxProposals`), or oversized file (`maxEditBytes`) aborts; (4) `maxTurns` bounds the whole loop; (5) the strategy attributes edits to scope components and (6) the executor audits the actual git diff. The runtime is deliberately read+propose only — no write, no shell — so the executor remains the sole writer and the verification pipeline cannot be bypassed.
- **Honest outcomes**: `finish` with zero proposals returns `declined` ("investigation finished without any proposed edit") — no candidate is fabricated; `decline` propagates as `AgentDeclinedError`.
- **Production wiring**: `chatClientFromProvider(provider, model?)` adapts `Provider.chat`; `agentMutationStrategyFromProviderOptions({ tier, model, host, apiKey, ... })` builds the whole strategy from the interactive agent's `loadConfig()` defaults. The engine accepts `agentRuntime` (+ optional `agentVerifyCommands`) and auto-builds the agent-backed executor when no explicit `mutationExecutor` is given. The CLI exposes `--mutate --agent` (opt-in; the default stays heuristic).
