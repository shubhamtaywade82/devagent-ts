/**
 * RuntimeStepRunner — the kernel-native delegator for the Control Plane.
 *
 * The control plane (Orchestrator) is step-runner agnostic: it only knows
 * the `StepRunner` port (src/orchestrator/types.ts). Two implementations
 * exist, one per embedding style:
 *
 *   AgentStepRunner   — product turns. Delegates to `runUserMessage`, which
 *                       wraps the kernel run in the CLI's product policies
 *                       (escalation preamble, delegation addendum, skill
 *                       activation, learning episodes). Used by the CLI/TUI.
 *   RuntimeStepRunner — kernel runs. Maps the PlanStep directly onto the
 *                       kernel's ExecutionRequest port and spawns it through
 *                       `AgentRuntime.execute`. Used by kernel-embedded
 *                       products: headless runners, devagent-ts library
 *                       consumers, and future agent products that want plan
 *                       execution without the interactive CLI machinery.
 *
 * Outcome mapping (ExecutionResult.status → StepOutcome):
 *
 *   completed        → success    (output text + usage recorded for history)
 *   failed / timeout → retryable  (transient by contract; the retry cap and
 *                                 the replanner decide what happens next)
 *   cancelled        → blocking   (the operator asked to stop — retrying a
 *                                 cancelled run would override them)
 *   budget_exhausted → blocking   (an immediate retry against the same budget
 *                                 would re-exhaust it; the replan path owns
 *                                 restructuring the step)
 *
 * The embedding application owns the ExecutionContext (gateways, context
 * port, event sink) through `createContext` — the runner never builds
 * gateways itself, mirroring how `AgentRuntime.execute` receives its context.
 * That factory is also the seam where the orchestrator's abort signal is
 * threaded into the kernel run (the orchestrator documents this contract).
