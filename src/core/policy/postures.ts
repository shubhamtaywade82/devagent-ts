/**
 * Policy postures — named RulePolicyEngine presets for products.
 *
 * A posture answers "how much friction does this product want around tool
 * execution?". The gateway enforces whatever engine it is given; postures
 * are just ready-made engines so products don't hand-roll rule chains:
 *
 *   parity     — the CLI DevAgent's historical UX: only destructive shell,
 *                git push / PR creation, and file deletion ask; everything
 *                else flows. Financial side effects ALWAYS ask (review
 *                mandate: a tool that moves money can never bypass
 *                confirmation, even in parity mode). The paper-trade tool's
 *                confirmation is the one deliberate UX delta vs. the
 *                pre-kernel CLI.
 *   standard   — every tool at risk >= "high" asks (shell, git, github,
 *                docker-style surfaces). For products that want a visibly
 *                safer default than parity.
 *   restricted — risk >= "medium" asks, plus optional deny lists/ceilings.
 *                For unattended runners and the crypto agent.
 *
 * All postures keep ModeRestrictionRule (read-only agent modes deny
 * mutating tools) via RulePolicyEngine's built-in rule tail.
