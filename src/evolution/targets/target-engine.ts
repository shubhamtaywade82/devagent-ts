/**
 * Target Formation layer for the Nexum closed-loop self-development system.
 *
 * Inspired by the Aspire findings from the Self-Developing Agents research:
 * when the goal is vague, agents spend most of their effort operationalizing
 * the *target itself* rather than improving the target capability, and only a
 * small fraction of attempted checkpoints produce retained improvements.
 *
 * The TargetEngine therefore sits BETWEEN failure diagnosis and evolution
 * planning. It refuses to answer "which file should I change?" until it has
 * answered "what capability is actually failing?" — producing an
 * `ImprovementTarget` that binds symptoms, metrics, affected components, and
 * an evaluation plan to a single capability-level objective.
